There are many operator that you can use in programming. Operators can be categorised:

1. Arithmetic Operators
    +	Addition
    -	Subtraction
    *	Multiplication
    /	Division
    %	Modulus (Remainder)
    ** Exponentiation
    // Floor Division

2. Comparison (Relational) Operators
    ==	Equal
    !=	Not Equal
    >	Greater Than
    <	Less Than
    >= Greater Than or Equal
    <= Less Than or Equal

3. Logical Operators
    and
    or
    not

4. Assignment Operators
    =	Assignment
    +=	Addition Assignment
    -=	Subtraction Assignment
    *=	Multiplication Assignment
    /=	Division Assignment
    %=	Modulus Assignment
    **=	Exponentiation Assignment
    //=	Floor Division Assignment


5. Bitwise Operators
    &	Bitwise AND
    |	Bitwise OR
    ^	Bitwise XOR
    ~	Bitwise NOT (Inversion)
    <<	Left Shift
    >>	Right Shift

6. Membership Operators
    in	True if value/variable is found in the sequence
    not in	True if value/variable is not found in the sequence

7. Identity Operators
    is	True if both variables are the same object
    is not	True if both variables are not the same object
