# BaseCamp Problems and Assignements
Here you will find all the assignements that I have worked on for BaseCamp. Everything is organized in weekly folders. In every week you will find both assignemnts and problems. I also added a folder called practice which holds all my practice on the fundamentals of programming.

In the first 5 weeks I have used comments to explain what the code does and from week 6 I will be writing docstrings to explain the code in more depth.
